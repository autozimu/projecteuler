## Problem 4: Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


## Solution 1

Transverse from 100 x 100 to 999 x 999.

The key point would be how to check if a number is a palindrome. Basically,
there might be two methods. One can print the number to a string, then compare
the letters. Or one can check the digits of the number directly.
