## Problem 24: Lexicographic permutations

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one
possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations
are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The
lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

    012 021 102 120 201 210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutations of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9?
