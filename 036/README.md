## Problem 36: Double-base palindromes

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001 (binary), is a palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in
base 10 and base 2.

(Please note than the palindromic number, in either base, may not include
leading zeros.)


## Solution 1

Brute force. The versatile indexing of Python is quite powerful in this
question.
