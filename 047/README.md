## Problem 47: Distinct primes factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

$$
14 = 2 \times 7 \\
15 = 3 \times 5 \\
$$

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

$$
644 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 23 \\
645 = 3 \times 5 \ times 43 \\
646 = 2 \times 17 \times 19 \\
$$

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors.
What is the first of these numbers?


## Solution 1

Brute force. Be careful, this is quite time consuming, in Python, using about 50s. While using C to implement, it is within 0.2s.
