## Problem 40: Champernowne's constant

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive
integers:

$$
0.123456789101112131415161718192021...
$$

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If $d_n$ represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of
the following expression.

$$
d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times
d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}
$$



## Solution 1

Brute force.
