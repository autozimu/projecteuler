## Problem 9: Special Pythagorean triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

Find the product abc.


## Solution 1

Brute-force.

A few improvements:

- 3 < a < 333
- b < 500
