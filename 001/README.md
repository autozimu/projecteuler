## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution 1

Brute-force method. We could transverse every natural number below 1000,
checking if it is a multiple of 3 or 5. If it is, add it to sum.

## Solution 2

The sum of multiples of 3 or 5, equals to sum of multiples of 3 plus sum of
multiples of 5, minus by sum of multiples of 15.
