## Problem 12: Highly divisible triangle numer

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
So the 7-th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first
ten terms would be:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

     1: 1
     3: 1, 3
     6: 1, 2, 3, 6
    10: 1, 2, 5, 10
    15: 1, 3, 5, 15
    21: 1, 3, 7, 21
    28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
divisors?

## Solution 1

The n-th triangle numbers have the following formula:

$$
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Increase $n$ until $T_n$ has five hundred divisors.


## Solution 2

One step further, find all of $T_n$ prime factors, e.g., the index of prime
number p is m, then the number of divisors of $T_n$ shall be $\prod (m + 1)$.
